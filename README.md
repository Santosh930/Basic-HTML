Repository of the code that is written during the class.

Classroom instructions
Here are some instructions for being prepared for all our future classes:

Always join the class through your laptop and always try out the things that are being discussed in the class
Install VSCode: https://code.visualstudio.com/Download and keep it open during the class.
Make sure that you understand every concept which is taught in the class. If you don't understand anything, please communicate the same to me during the class. Drop a message in the chat or raise your hand (if that is an option)
If you are uncomfortable in English, and if you are really struggling in understanding a concept and want me to explain it again in Hindi, please mention that in the chat, and I will explain that concept in Hindi.
But please try your best to understand the concepts in English itself. If I explain every concept in both languages, we will become very slow and will take double the time to complete this course.

Additional Resources
Somethings that will help you in your job interviews, but aren't covered in the course are:

Spoken English
Please practice listening and speaking English. You can watch English movies in English audio (preferably without subtitles) to practice listening. And try to practice speaking in English with anyone you live with: your siblings (brother/sister) if you live at home, with your friends and classmates, or your flatmates and hostelmates if you live away from home.

Touch Typing
Touch typing means typing without looking at the keyboard. It helps in avoiding typing mistakes - which are the single biggest source of bugs. If you learn how to touch type, you will be able to write better working code, do everything faster and it will also impress your interviewer during your technical interviews. Here is a website that you can use to learn touch typing: https://www.typingclub.com/sportal/program-3.game

Linux Shell (basic level)
These are used to perform normal actions in your computer using the terminal (or Powershell) instead of using the graphical user interface. Learning these will enable you to do a lot more with your computers that you currently can. It will enable you to use your computer without using the mouse/touchpad, which will greatly increase your speed and productivity. Here is a link that you can use to learn the basic commands: https://www.javatpoint.com/linux-commands

Git
Git is the single most important software that you must learn to be a software developer. Git is a version control system and a collaboration system which enables people to work on the same codebase for a long time. You should practice keeping every single work file version controlled in Git. You can see the basic git commands in this link.

GitHub/GitLab/Gitae/BitBucket
These websites make it easy to collaborate in teams using Git. This blog on FreeCodeCamp can help you get started with it.
